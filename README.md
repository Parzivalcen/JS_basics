# A repo for my JS basics learning

Its being harder than I thought it would, specially functions for now, some exercises took me hours just to find a simple solution, but I embrace hard things so is great, I'm moving forward.

I made some functionality for some websites projects before, that was kind of easy, almost all the code needed was out there, that made me think that I already was fluent in JS, but it turns out I was not :))))
